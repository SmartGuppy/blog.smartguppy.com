Like clockwork, every Singaporean student never fails to start off his/her day at school with this pledge at school. Having recited this line multitudinous times conscientiously from the age of six, I grew up believing that Singapore is built on meritocracy and equality. We even have a designated day - 21st July to highlight the importance of racial harmony and tolerance. How is it then that even in today’s day and age, top leaders of our nation can comment that “Singapore is not ready for a non-Chinese PM” ? 

In light of the recent elections, several controversies stole the spotlight. One such example would be the case against Raeesah Khan for making baseless accusations that the Singapore police discriminates against minorities. However, are there no clear parallels between that case and the above statement made by DPM Heng Swee Keat that the “Older generations” are not ready for a non-chinese PM? There has been nothing but an absence of evidence to support this claim. Post-elections, it may even be concluded that the results weaken his assertion. With a 74.62% victory, the Jurong PAP team led by Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, outwardly surpassed both current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Leong’s and DPM Heng Swee Keat’s GRCs by 2.71% and 21.21% respectively **[1]**. The exceedingly high statistic in which the community seems to favour the leadership of Tharman, is enough to dispel the DPM’s remark since an Indian has clearly won much more support over his Chinese counterparts. 

Race aside, shouldn’t the primary criteria for selecting our Prime Minister boil down to merit? In a society known for its pressure cooker education system, Singaporean students face high levels of stress just to excel in their studies so that they will be rewarded with better opportunities. In  a nation that has scarce resources with the exception of its people (labour), these circumstances are understood to be a necessity. Hence, shouldn’t the same standards of meritocracy set in when it comes to selecting our leader? Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam is the first Singaporean candidate to have been shortlisted for the head position at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) **[2]**. With even global agencies recognising his talent, it is definitely a shame that certain fellow Singaporeans are discrediting his achievements and potential due to his racial background. 

Historically, there have been several successful Singaporean politicians from a minority ethnic group. S. Rajaratnam - a cofounder of the People’s Action Party alongside Lee Kuan Yew - played a key role as Singapore's first foreign minister, in gaining Singapore a seat at the United Nations **[3]** and not to mention successfully guiding Singapore through the Cold War. Yusof Ishak - Singapore’s first president and promoter of multiculturalism especially after the 1964 racial riots **[4]**. J. B. Jeyaretnam - the first opposition politician since Singapore's independence in 1965 to have been voted into Parliament **[5]**. Surely, he wouldn't have been elected if Singaporeans  had  voted purely along the lines of race? And this list goes on. 

Bearing in mind that SM Tharman had mentioned not seeing himself taking on the role of PM during the 2015 SG50+ Conference, this entire controversy might seem completely irrelevant. However, it made me question the validity of his statement as he is afterall still a member of the ruling party- PAP of which DPM Heng Swee Keat belongs to. Not wanting to take up the role of PM may be more aligned with his political party’s view as opposed to his personal opinion. But of course, if it is truly his preference to decline the position of PM, I would respect his decision since we ascribe to the values of democracy. The above arguments would only hold if this is not the case. 

Regardless of SM Tharman’s choice in the candidacy of PM, Singapore has long been ready for a non-Chinese PM. Even in our early days, several individuals in power from minority ethnicities have been responsible for building up the landscape we live in today. It is thus unfair and ludicrous to deny a deserving candidate the role of PM just due to their ethnicity especially in a multicultural society so painstakingly built by our Founders. Because that is afterall the most superficial difference between our 4 main races - with the exception of Mother Tongue which should be irrelevant in a nation where English has been assigned as our First Language **[6]**. More importantly though, we should identify ourselves first as Singaporeans, regardless of race, language or religion.
