When just being normal is bad, really bad and being technical is horrible.


How does one ever define a 12 year old child and put him or her into certain categories when we realise every child has truly great untapped potential still waiting to unbounded and unleashed? Well, the PSLE just did it again, a few days back. The Primary School Leaving Examinations where young children are streamed/determined/labelled/defined into an identity that plays a major influence on their self worth and belief. Here, to most parents: being 'normal' is never a good thing (less said about being techincal) and being labelled as 'express' is the bare minimum. Depending on which secondary school one chooses, a child can either be in the normal or express stream, such is the abitrariness of the T-score. 

##__ A self-fufilling prophecy?

In secondary schools, labels take on an even greater meaning especially to adolescents searching for their own self-identity and crucially, their self-worth in the process. Every student being streamed and labelled as Normal (NA) or Technical(NT) ****knows**** that they are not really just 'normal' but instead are inferior to the majority of their 'Express' peers. This is very dangerous as it does not just translate into academic inferiority but presupposes, unfairly by the majority of their 'Express' peers and generally by society, inferiority in other aspects as well. Being 'normal academic' or 'technical' does not just heavily affect and influence a child's academic ability but his or her overall self-worth as well. How can they be normal when the majority is not? How is the majority not the normal? Perhaps maybe they really are not that 'normal' and soon realise it is misguided lie and that they are just truly inferior afterall.


## Lost potential?

NA and NT students are facing not just stigma (which is a big problem in itself) but both conscious and unconscious discrimination from schools as well. Instead of starting on an equal playing field,

## Can schools(or WE) solve this problem and end the prophecy?
