## You will be shocked to hear what is the best way of choosing the best secondary school.

PSLE results are out. If your child has done well, kudos to him or her, there will be many options for your child to choose from. If your child hasn't, then there will be a more limited choice as the so called 'better' schools will tend to have higher PSLE cut-off points. So for those who didn't do well, are all schools with lower cut-off points really bad then? And amongst those schools, how do you choose the best one then? The number 1 factor that almost all parents assume and use to judge secondary schools are their PSLE cut-off points. This can be flawed and it might even have a negative impact on your children's secondary school's future. So what is the best way to choose then? Read on! But first, let's debunk a few assumptions...

### The Worst of the Best? Or the Best of the Worst?

Sending your child to the school with the highest cut-off point that he or she can qualify even might not be in the best interest of your child. For example, if your child has a PSLE score of 240, sending your child to a secondary school where he or she just barely made the cut-off points of 240 might not be such a good idea. Your child might be assigned to the so called 'last class' of the school. Furthermore, he or she might struggle to compete academically in a tougher environment, which might leave your child with the worst subject choices when it comes to streaming into secondary 3. A child from an 'elite' school might not be able to do his or her favourite subject combinations as compared to being in less competitive school. Your child might be better able to flourish in a school where there is less academic competition. Going to a school where with a PSLE score of 240 places your child into the top classes might be better. Being the best of the worst instead of the worst of the best here might wiser, enabling yout child to flourish and succeed better, especially with the school's recognition of your child's abilities and support.


### The higher the cut-off point, the better the secondary school? Not really!

Most parents will focus on the PSLE cut-off point of the school as a main guide to judging the quality of the school. However, this is not the most important factor into determining whether the school is good or not.
